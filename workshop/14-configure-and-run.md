# Configure and Run #

We now have the building blocks in place to make our robot arm move! (Can we get a Yipee!).

The first thing we need to do is get the IP Address of our machine.

- Ooen a command prompt and get your machine IP Address with;

    ```
    ipconfig
    ```

- Make a note of the IP Address, for example `192.168.1.162`;

</p>

- Open the robot_firmware project on the Raspberry Pi.
- Replace the `<PC IP Address>` section in the `Program.cs` file with the PC Ip Address. For instance;

    ```cs
    connection = new HubConnectionBuilder()
                    .WithUrl("https://192.168.1.162:5001/chathub",conf =>
                    {
                        conf.HttpMessageHandlerFactory = (x) => new HttpClientHandler
                        {
                            ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback = HttpClientHandler.DangerousAcceptAnyServerCertificateValidator,
                        };                    
                    })
                    .Build();
    ```

We can now see if it all works...

- Return to the Blazor App, and start it up.
- You may need to allow the SignalR Service through your firewall;

- Finally, return to your PUTtY Session and run your robot code one last time

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```
    
- You should now be able to move the sliders and control your robot arm remotely... Congratulations!!!
