# Raspberry Pi Robot Workshop! #

## Introduction

Welcome to this workshop on creating a Robot Arm with Raspberry Pi, .NET 5, Blazor and SignalR!

In this workshop I'll take you through everything you need to build a robot arm with a Raspberry Pi, .NET 5 a Blazor App and SignalR.

We'll begin by installing .NET 5, then we'll connect up the various components to our Raspberry Pi.

Next we'll connect up some LEDs and Resistors to a breadboard, and  spin up a console application to explore how we can control the GPIO on the Pi.

We'll then wire up some Servos and get the code in place to start moving our Raspberry pi based Robot Arm.

Finally we'll build out a simple Blazor and SignalR app to control our robot remotely!

- Or, if you're really adventurous, some Cardboard, sellotape and a gluegun if you want to build the components into a diy robot arm!

This workshop will appeal to all knowledge levels. A working knowledge of programming will help, but all the code will be shared on GitHub!
